<h1 align="center">My Super Website! :rocket:</h1> 

### :question: Why?
Lots of people fill their professional profiles with plenty of certificates.
More certificates make your more employable right? The answer is not so straightforward. 
What use are the certifications if you don't apply what you learn into making something new?
This is where this repository comes in! 

I've recently learned HTML/CSS and wanted to put my skills to the test by creating a webpage of my own.
I also pretended to get acquainted with Git and GitHub and therefore combined both objectives.
This was the result: **my first webpage and my first repository!**

### :computer: What is it about?
The webpage is very simple. Content wise, it contains:

- A section where I speak a bit about me. 
- A section where I "flex" some of my tech skills.
- A "Frequently Asked Questions" section where you can check what I am up to!

 Additionally: 

- Made it responsive to different screen sizes.
- Made it interactive with some clickable buttons. 

### :hammer: Used Technologies
