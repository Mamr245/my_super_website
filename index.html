                <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>I started my professional career as a mechanical engineer but always loved digital technologies. 
                    Once the opportunity to work in the IT industry appeared I decided to give it a try and so I became a software tester.
                    I also enjoy programming a lot and learnt how to program using Python and JAVA. Furthermore, since I've recently learnt about HTML and CSS 
                    I decided to put my skills to the test and build this webpage where I talk a bit about myself so that you can get to know me better. 
                    I intend on doing more projects and post about them here but I'm taking it one step a time. Other than programming I enjoy:</p>
